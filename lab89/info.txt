1) ASSUMPTIONS
    There is no particular constraint on the cardinality of the set to run the simulation on.
    In the absence of an empirical distribution to sue for the birthdays(or the general property 
        in case the extension is being considered) a uniformly distributed random variable will be used.
        
2) INPUT PARAMETERS
    - Parameter regarding the type of distribution to use for the data (Uniform/real from csv file)
    - Cardinality of the population
    - Seeds

3) OUTPUT METRICS
    - Average number of people to observe a conflict.
    - Probability of a birthday conflict in function of the cardinality of the population.
    - Accuracy with theoretical results.

4) DATA STRUCTURES
    - List of objects to store information about the property on which to check possible conflicts.
    - An object representing either people or a general element with one single property that's the one
        we want to assert the conflict on.

5) MAIN ALGORITHMS
    - To evaluate the average number of conflicts:
        for object in objects:
            check if current_obj collides with any other_obj
            counter++
            stop
        recreate population with according distribution and cardinality

    - To evaluate the probability in function of the chosen cardinality:
            Compute probability p_exp
            return p_exp, p_exp/p_theoretical * 100

6) EXTENSIONS
    Generalized version of the birthday problem.
